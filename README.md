## Section 3
This chapter asserts that the federal government's civil service system, designed to be merit-based and apolitical, has become bloated, inefficient, and resistant to change.

Here are key recommendations:

**Office of Personnel Management (OPM):**

* **Reintroduce rigorous merit-based hiring:**  Replace the ineffective self-evaluation system with updated examinations like USAHire, potentially revise Uniform Guidelines to enable general intelligence tests.

## Section 23
This chapter presents two contrasting views on the Export-Import Bank (EXIM). 

**The first view argues that EXIM should be abolished.** It claims the Bank:

* Promotes corporate welfare by subsidizing large corporations like Boeing, not small businesses.
* Redistributes jobs rather than creating them, as most EXIM-financed exports would occur anyway.
* Distorts the economy and slows growth by diverting resources towards subsidized exports.
* Fails to level the playing field because it unfairly advantages politically connected firms.

**The second view advocates for maintaining and strengthening EXIM.** It argues:

* The U.S. needs a strong EXIM to counter China's aggressive Belt and Road Initiative and protect American jobs and businesses.
* Other countries are adapting their ECAs to compete with China, putting U.S. exporters at a disadvantage.
* EXIM provides financing only when the private sector cannot, operates with low default rates, and generates profits for taxpayers.

The chapter highlights the contrasting views within the conservative movement regarding the role of government in international trade and the appropriate response to China's economic rise. 



## Section 24

**Monetary Rule Reform Options:**

* **Free Banking:** Abolish the Fed and allow private banks to issue currency backed by valuable commodities, leading to a stable, decentralized monetary system.

**Fair Trade:**

* Argues that the U.S. is a victim of unfair, unbalanced, and nonreciprocal trade, leading to chronic trade deficits and the offshoring of American jobs and industries.
* Advocates for the **U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act (USRTA)**, which would give the President authority to raise tariffs to match those of trading partners who refuse to lower their barriers.
* Highlights the economic and national security threats posed by Communist China's aggressive mercantilist policies and "debt-trap diplomacy."
* Calls for decoupling from China economically and financially, through measures such as increased tariffs, investment restrictions, and sanctions. 

**Free Trade:**

* Acknowledges trade's disruptive effects but emphasizes the greater impact of technological change and the overall benefits of a dynamic economy.
* Opposes the Trump-era tariffs, arguing they raise consumer prices, harm American businesses, and have failed to change China's behavior.
* Advocates for tariff relief, repeal of protectionist laws like the Jones Act, and a renewed focus on trade agreements with allies.
* Recommends strengthening the WTO or creating a successor organization limited to liberal democracies.
* Calls for a multi-pronged approach to China that combines diplomatic pressure, cultural engagement, and strategic alliances with allies.

**Key Points of Debate:**

* **Consumer Welfare vs. Broader Concerns:** While acknowledging the importance of consumer welfare, some conservatives argue that antitrust should also address threats to free speech, political discourse, and a healthy civil society posed by concentrated corporate power.
* **ESG and DEI as Anticompetitive Tools:** Concerns are raised about corporations using ESG and DEI initiatives to gain favorable regulatory treatment, potentially masking anticompetitive behavior.
* **"Cancel Culture" as an Unfair Trade Practice:**  Businesses that refuse service based on political views, particularly those with market power and government privileges, may be engaging in unfair trade practices.

Some favor regulation, while others emphasize parental responsibility and caution against unintended consequences.

**Recommended Actions:**

* **Investigate ESG/DEI collusion:** Create a task force to examine whether companies use these initiatives to engage in anticompetitive practices.
* **Address Big Tech censorship:**  Interpret Section 230 to limit Big Tech's immunity and impose transparency rules on content moderation. Support legislation that prohibits viewpoint discrimination.
